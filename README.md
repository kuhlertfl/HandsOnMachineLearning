Hands-On Machine Learning Projects
About This Repository
This repository is a collection of my learning journey and projects undertaken while studying "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. It's aimed at documenting the practical aspects of machine learning I have learned, including various models, algorithms, and techniques as presented in the book.

Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts and tools by applying them to real-world datasets and scenarios. Each project or notebook within this repository represents a specific chapter or concept covered in the book.

Structure
Chapter Summaries: Concise notes on key concepts, formulas, and techniques from each chapter.
Code Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing Python code, exercises, and examples as I work through the book.
Datasets: Links to datasets used in my projects, along with brief descriptions and outcomes of the analyses.
Technologies Used
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
TensorFlow & Keras: For deep learning projects.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the notebooks and code to get an insight into how different machine learning concepts can be applied. Each notebook is well-commented to make it easier to follow along.

Contributing
While this project is primarily for my personal learning and documentation, I'm open to suggestions, feedback, and contributions from other machine learning enthusiasts. If you have any ideas or notice any errors, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
